      The relay station drifted half a million kilometers off its assigned
      orbit, and nobody had noticed except Mara and the dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      On her screen, the network map was a sparse constellation of green
      dots—colonies, freighters, mining rigs—each one pinging the relay in a
      slow, patient heartbeat. Traffic through the band was low. Too low.
    </p>

    <p>
      She tapped the console, more out of habit than hope. The same thin
      stream of requests and acknowledgements scrolled by. Status: stable.
      Status: nominal. Status: alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The station hummed around her: fans, coolant pumps, the soft grind of
      aging gyros. Outside, there was nothing—no nearby ships, no moonlight,
      no reflected glow from any planetary disk. Just background stars and the
      cold noise of the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, under the regular cadence of signals, something new blinked into
      the log. A packet with no routing data. No origin. No destination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just a timestamp that shouldn’t exist.
    </p>

    <p><em>Received: 23:19:04 UTC, 07.14.2249</em></p>

    <p>
      Mara frowned. The current year was 2248.
