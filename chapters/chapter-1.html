 <p><strong>The Disconnected</strong> were left dormant, never developing what has become known as <strong>The Minds</strong>. A genetic link that enables users to control technology with their emotions. Those who were awakened were known as <strong>the Integrated</strong>. The Minds were created centuries ago when an entity known as The System threatened to leave humanity behind. Integration of The Minds was controlled by CelTec, only awakening a small part of the population. Those who were awakened were entitled to riches and an ease of life that most men only dreamed of. <strong>The Library of Archived Minds</strong> Entry #958</p>

<p>The crackling of static could be heard from the old TV in the middle of the room. The reporter’s chalk white hair was thrown tightly to the back of his head in a bun. His nose was red from the cold. Mr. Studd sat on the couch as he rhythmically flipped his ring between his fingers. His mind lay adrift, calculating as he stared at the screen.</p>

<p>“The next great gift to humanity, a new wave of Integrated and a new era of CelTec. The next great step in evolution.” The reporter's voice echoed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Studd sat Ralphie down on the cushions. He looked around, puzzled, his face still full and chubby. “Here, you take him, this came for you.” It was an olive green letter with a rough texture. Cliff Studd was written on the front in deep black ink in a stately font. Mr. Studd tossed the letter to the side with neglect. Before he held Ralphie up into the air. “Look at these,” he said in a warm voice, separate from his frightenedly cold eyes.</p>

<p>Ralphie was fitted in his favorite blue pajamas with little stars.</p>

<p>Mr. Studd let out a sigh as he turned to the television. “Jessica, what do you think about this?”</p>

<p>Jessica's eyes shone a bright grey, the same color as Ralphie's. “The disconnected are out celebrating. These experiments don’t help CelTec create more Integrated. But for CelTec, it's simple, no one will care; everyone is too worried about becoming integrated.” Mrs. Studd looked down at Ralphie; a spider-web of drool hung firmly from his mouth.</p>

<p>“How do we raise a kid with all of this?” She asked as she dabbed his mouth.</p>

<p>“Well, first we need to do something about your work. They're afraid of you. They have already threatened us once. I won’t be able to raise them on my own.” Mr. Studd shifted nervously.</p>

<p>”I’m working on it. I will hide what I can; you know more than anyone that I want to be there for my boys; otherwise, what is the point? I will not sacrifice them for this world.”</p>

<p>Mr. Studd smiled at his wife. She was braver than most. “I never asked you to. Have we put Freddie to sleep yet?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Studd nodded, “I put him to sleep a little while ago. He sleeps through the night surprisingly well.”</p>

<p>There was a loud clash that sounded out amongst their conversation. A muffled grumble could be heard in the nearby room, followed by a long, painful groan.</p>

<p>Mr. Studd lifted Ralphie, setting him on the ground. “I’ll go check on him.” Ralphie's legs wobbled back and forth for a bit before he took a couple of steps forward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Studd's father was a frail old man. He had a grey, wispy beard and circular glasses that pressed tightly against the bridge of his nose. His neck was so thin that when he talked, his muscles could be seen contracting. He always wore a ribbed blue beanie, usually dressed in a flannel and a pair of loose blue jeans. He sat with his back against the wall, blood covering his starkly pale arm. A chip was carved out of the sink's side where he had fallen.</p>

<p>Mr. Studd knelt, examining the cut, “Come on, Tommy, give me your arm.”</p>

<p>Tommy mumbled, “I’m sorry the two of you shouldn’t have to look after me.”</p>

<p>Tommy had been battling with a rare form of Alzheimer's. It was treatable, but the only known cure was branded by CelTec and was too expensive for how old Tommy was. Cliff grabbed hold of his arm. He didn’t know how long Tommy had left.</p>

<p>Cliff reached into the cabinet, pulling out band tape. A yellow and black checkered bandage is designed for any type of wound. As he wrapped it around Tommy's arm, it flattened out flush against his skin. The color darkened until it matched the tone of his arm, hiding the cut.</p>

<p>Tommy sighed, “How did I make it this far?”</p>

<p>“Glad you did,” Cliff cleaned the blood off the counter.</p>

<p>Tommy smiled before letting out a sigh, “I’m not sure how you two do it. The world is pinned against you. I shouldn't be dying like this.”</p>

<p>Jessica smiled at her dad, who still had the glowing radiance of youth in her eyes. "You're not dead yet."</p>

<p>”I might as well be. Did you get a chance to read the letter?” Tommy asked</p>

<p>“Not yet, come on, get up”, Cliff said with his arm entangled with Tommy's. Tommy shuffled over to his daughter, embracing her. He reeked of tobacco.</p>

<p>The TV had shifted from the reporter to the streets of Cardinal City, millions of people dressed in white and gold cheered on Pollard, the President of CelTec. He drove down the streets in an ash grey convertible, followed by bright yellow cars glistening with white blocky stars. The yellow cars were no doubt filled with Blues.</p>

<p>Tommy grunted as he sat down, before he poked Ralphie in the belly, causing him to laugh. He pointed to the letter, “You need to read that.”</p>

<p>“Tommy, who is this from?” Cliff asked.</p>

<p>Tommy didn’t look up, continuing to play with Ralphie,“I’m told it's important, a friend of yours.” Tommy was fascinated with Ralphie. He had his entire life ahead of him.</p>

<p>Ralphie waddled his way up to the TV, entranced by all of the dazzling colors. “Come on, Ralphie, let's get you to sleep,” Mrs. Studd said. The exhaustion was making her vision blurry. Ralphie was glued to the screen. They were talking about a procedure called numbing to help quiet some of the more disorienting features of The Minds. Mrs. Studd picked up Ralphie, tearing him away before walking him to his room.</p>

<p>“Can you put the Autonomous Reporter back on the screen?” Tommy asked.</p>

<p>Mr.Studd, with the letter in his hand, looked up at the TV screen, changing the channel to the Autonomous Reporter before going back to the letter, studying it carefully.</p>

<p>“Bad News?” Tommy asked</p>

<p>Cliff took another look over the letter, rereading it carefully, “I’m not sure. The hard part about trying to start a revolution in this age is that you need all the right pieces to come together at the right time. CelTec has a good way of staying ahead of us, and Chuck seems to be losing his foothold.” Cliff took a giant sigh, his gaze reaching the end of the paper; he set it down on the couch.</p>

<p>The Autonomous Reporter was one of the many brilliances of The Old Minds, a branch of The Minds that was largely untouched by CelTec from before; people were split into Integrated and Disconnected. Anyone could report on the Autonomous Reporter; it was the system's job to select the stories that would be broadcast to the world.</p>

<p>A little girl had tears streaming down her face, sniffling as she talked. The white, blue neon glow of the CelTec Medical Facility tinted her and everything around her.</p>

<p>The Graphic on the screen revealed her as the daughter of a woman killed by CelTec; she was disconnected. The girl on the screen tried hard to keep her voice stable, as it kept shaking. She held a small microphone in between her hands, trying hard to keep it steady and close to her mouth. The CelTec logo pasted on the side of it meant it picked up on the girl's voice through the vibrations in her skull.</p>

<p>Her voice radiated perfectly through the screen. The words rang out, ”I thought they would give us a better life. They lied about giving her the Minds.” The mother's body displayed on the screen was tattered with scars.</p>

<p>A shadow of a man appeared to walk out of the hospital. The man's face was fuzzy, along with the rest of his body. He held a bright shining light, perhaps a flashlight. As the man stepped out from the light, his shimmering outline vanished.</p>

<p>Tommy's eyes were keenly fixed on the screen. He sat up suddenly, “Did any of you see that?” Both Mr. and Mrs. Studd shook their heads. “Never mind,” Tommy said, slightly shaken.</p>

<p>Mr.Studd focused on the screen before pointing at it, “Are you talking about the girl's arm?” There was a slight orange tint and squiggly lines that ran down her arm before encompassing her hand in bright swirls around her knuckles.</p>

<p>“No, that is peculiar,” Tommy replied. The girl ended the rest of what she was saying before the screen went black. It shifted to a man whose clothes were soaked by rain. He began rambling on about his concern for CelTec’s ability to conduct experiments independently and without regulations.</p>

<p>Mrs. Studds's face was filled with sadness, “This is it, isn’t it?” she said.</p>

<p>“For now,” Tommy replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Studd looked at the two of them, “CelTec has complete control. They are kidnapping the Disconnected, and eventually, they will come for us. We know too much.”</p>

<p>Tommy smirked, “You're optimistic.” The three of them sat watching the television swirl through the changes that CelTec was going to make. Now that they retained what seemed like permanent power, they wondered what this new world would look like. The Autonomous Reporter flipped from person to person; most of the reports had something to do with CelTec's policies. Curfews that would be established, and the presence of Blues in cities and towns.</p>

<p>Although eventually the reports became more personal. Families that had been disbanded or displaced. People who had escaped from the experiments were left dismembered.</p>

<p>The reporter also shifted to certain newly elected CelTec officials, including Chuck Thorne. “Chuck Thorne is the newly appointed assistant director, earning himself a vote within CelTec’s Regional Board.” The reporter on the screen stated in a booming voice.</p>

<p>”Good for him.” Tommy said, smiling as his eyes were beginning to become bloodshot from not blinking. “You're going to need him.”</p>

<p>“I know, he’s reliable.” Mr.Studd said, turning up the TV so that the volume radiated throughout the entire house.</p>

<p>“How high up do you think he will go?” Tommy was exhausted, as his back sank into the couch.</p>

<p>Mr. Studd scratched his head, “He's popular, I don’t know what it would take out of him, but I think he could make it to their global team.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Studd took on a questioning tone, “How long has he been with CelTec?” She asked.</p>

<p>”He started working there just after we graduated from college. It's been at least fifteen years now,” Mr. Studd yawned, stretching out. They stayed up late watching the flicker of the television. Hours passed before they slipped into sleep. The Television kept buzzing on through the night.</p>

<p>In the morning, the sun was bright and the rays of sunshine beamed through the windows into the living room. Tommy and Mr. Studd rolled over to the other side of the couch to shield some of the sun from their eyes. Mrs. Studd decided that she was already awake, stretching her arms out wide, yawning as she wiggled some blood back into her fingers and toes. She stood up, taking a moment to listen as the birds chirped in the sounds of the morning. It was a lovely sound.</p>

<p>The stone floor was cold against her feet, but it helped to wake her up. She knew that Ralphie would be hungry as soon as he woke up. As she went about scrambling the eggs, she noticed how quiet the house was when no one was awake. The sun illuminated little dust particles that floated in the air before swiftly swirling around the room. Mrs. Studd smiled; she always imagined that little dust butterflies were flying in the air. It was strange last night and felt like it might have been the end of the world for her. Things were changing rapidly; she felt her heart swell. She walked over and picked up the letter that had come last night.</p>

<p>To The Studds,  I’m sorry I couldn’t make it in person. I was hoping to see little Ralphie. I hope he is doing well. The world is changing much faster than I could have ever imagined, with CelTec growing much bigger than they were intended to. The Minds were once considered a gift to humanity, but now they are used to label us as inferior. I fear for the Disconnected; they are going missing, entire families disappearing in the blink of an eye. Pollard is not in control, at least I don’t think so. There is someone else who is pulling the strings, someone else who is in charge.</p>

<p>I must protect our ideas at all costs. I'm afraid I must disappear from this world right now, to protect the original idea that seeded the creation of The Minds. What this world is becoming is Devoid of anything but desire for oneself. If that is the case, then so be it. I will be here when I’m needed. But, my friends, do not worry, the world has a way of correcting itself, and I believe that you two are part of that correction. One day, young Ralphie will be a part of this correction, too. Stay vigilant and true to yourselves. Implore Ralphie to seek out answers to why this planet works the way it does. His world is not set in stone.</p>

<p>Their generation may be more important in fighting this than we are. As I have to leave, there are some things I must pass on to you. CelTec is building weapons to the extent that I am unsure. They prepare for war. What I do know is this, they have emitted a gas into the atmosphere that reveals who has The Minds, they call it skin etching. The disconnected are being lured into CelTec experiments because they are told they will become Integrated. It is impossible, a false promise.</p>

<p>These experiments serve a different purpose. I am unsure why they are doing this, but it’s important. That's all that I have. You must keep fighting and stay safe. Oh, one last thing, Jedd found a piece of parchment when breaking into one of the CelTec research facilities. It read, There are whispers of a man named Dullahan.  Much Love and Farewell, J.G</p>

<p>The was a loud sequential thump that pounded throughout the house. Jessica set the letter down swiftly, sliding it across the counter till it was concealed. Cliff and Tommy moved around restlessly on the couch, sleep still gripping them tightly. Jessica stared at the door, unwavering as a cold taste of iron filled her mouth. The silence had her stunned as she waited for another knock at the door. But there wasn’t one, just pure silence.</p>

<p>Jessica nudged Cliff and Tommy awake; they stretched and yawned as they woke up. It didn’t take long before Cliff recognized the look on Jessica’s face. She always had quite the knack for danger. A sixth sense that seemed too good. He started looking around; it was still quite early, and the world had not even begun to wake up.</p>

<p>Cliff asked in a hushed voice where Ralphie and Freddie were. He was assured that they were in their room. There was another set of thumps that came from the door, softer this time. Cliff stared at the door. Everything felt wrong. He crept towards the door, worried at what he might find. Jessica grabbed his arm as they walked together. Tommy watched from behind the safety of the couch.</p>

<p>As Cliff reached for the slick doorknob, there was a distinct scream from one of the rooms inside the house. Jessica and Cliff looked at each other as Tommy tried to shuffle sickly towards the noise. It was distinctly Freddie's scream; he began wailing the bloodcurdling scream of a newborn. They left the door running to Freddie's room to face a Blue.</p>

<p>The Blue sat there in the narrow hallway, his skin covered in the distinctive skin-tight navy blue with protective padding stitched around him. It was a bright, ugly color as the daylight shone on it. He did not move the sleek gun pointed at Cliff and Jessica. Jessica was instantly filled with tears, not of sadness but of pure rage. Cliff held onto her as she fought to try and claw her way towards the Blue.</p>

<p>He knew that she would likely be killed if she charged at the Blue. He tried to beg. His eyes, welling up with sadness. But the Blue did not budge or respond, staying perfectly silent, holding his position. The wailing from Freddie grew louder from inside the room as another Blue walked out of the room carrying Freddie in his arms. The Blues' beaded black eyes stared at Freddie before looking up at Jessica as a warning. Cliff was strong, but not strong enough, as Jessica tore the muscles in her arms to pivot around him, charging at the Blue.</p>

<p>With the gun still aimed at them and the swift stroke of the trigger, Jessica fell to the floor with a bullet in her shoulder. It was too precise a shot to kill her, merely to act as a warning. Cliff ran over to her side as the Blues stepped over them. They said nothing as they passed by Tommy, only staring as they walked out the door with Freddie in their hands.</p>

<p>Tommy held Cliff's shoulder as he wept, applying band tape to Jessica’s shoulder. She had been knocked unconscious from the shock, and it would be several hours before he woke. Tommy looked down at the blood that had pooled on the floor; bloody footprints were traced around the house from the Blues' boots. There was a creek from one of the rooms. Tommy looked up to see Ralphie standing at the entrance of his room at the end of the hallway. His eyes were wide with fear and shock.</p>
